Enhancer
========

Enhancer is a set of tools that in my course of programming I've created to boost/enhance my code to make it easier to the eyes. It is my personal ever-growing Swiss Armi Knife for coding.

Enhancer.NET
------------

Enhancer.NET is the .NET variant for Enhancer is mainly for C# and Windows Forms, but it can be used for other .NET language, and may contains helper for other libraries as well.

Legal
-----

Enhancer's main purpose is to help my code. I only use free & public resources and my knowledge to extend this library, and those are usually simple algorithms or structures. I do not reverse engineer any other product to create them.

Using Enhancer
--------------

Although Enhancer is up in GitHub for my personal use and for my convenience, but if you decide to use Enhancer in a public project, please put a reference in your project that you use Enhancer, but you're free to go.
Alternatively I would like you to [drop me a mail with this link][1] if you use it in any kind of project.
